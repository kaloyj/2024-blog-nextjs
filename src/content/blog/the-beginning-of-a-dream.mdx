## the actual beginning

I've always believed that having dreams and fulfilling them is a privilege not everyone has, myself included. We grew up choosing careers with the highest chances of thriving and growing out of poverty, that we've abandoned the idea of passion and dreams.

I'm 27 years old now, and I've done so much self discovery these past years â€” from moving to Europe alone, to meticulously introspecting every detail of the past, all in the hopes of discovering the possibilities of the world out there, and in.

What I've found however, is that all these years of rushing the achievement of "dreams", and of making it out to the other side, is that the kid we abandoned growing up will always flourish through, even throughout the struggle.

I didn't notice it really, but you get through life long enough and you start looking deeper, onto why we do certain things: why I liked mint chocolate, why I take joy in food, how I am with my friends, the way I act with my relationships, and the way I see myself in the mirror or even through others.

It's the child poking through all the struggle and saying "Hey, remember me?" 

The thought of completing the unfinished, or even the unspoken, the cravings, and the dreams of that little kid, is at the end, the root of all the things i've been doing all along.

It's like catching up on lost time, really. Lost time on a kid enjoying hobbies, or enjoying the simple pleasures of candy and the memory of having it, or the joy of celebrating the normal things in life with friends, and simply the awareness of growing and having people around you on that journey.

And for having dreams, life long dreams with the passion to pursue it, and having people around you who nurture and push you towards that dream - but this time it's not a distant wish, but it's within hand's reach.

## the (re) beginning of a dream

This leads us to the resurgence of dreams and the hopes of pursuing it.

If you have been in my life in the past 3 years and a half, I may have had the greatest pleasure of cooking for you in a dinner, brunch, or some get together here in our home.

To elaborate dinner menus, to simple brunch meals, or holidays like Christmas and thanksgiving, you would have noticed the joy I had from doing these events, with friends gathered over a table filled with food and bottles of wine to share, talking about each other's lives and stories.

I have had the honor of hosting friends over, cooking food and infusing as much Filipino influence as I could have ever done, and documenting these informally to social media or simply keeping the memories in my hand-held camera.

This, combined with the kind and honest feedback from friends, plus the real life experiences of friends hosting and creating events, even restaurants from dreams, have fueled me the same way I was determined I would create the life I wanted in Europe, three years ago.

I can't say much for what the project will be as I am still finalizing the pieces together, but I'm writing to tell you to giddy up as i am quite literally (and figuratively) cooking something for you.

It'll come in phases! I will be in the coming months documenting <i>things</i> with more of these blogs, hosting more events, creating videos, curating a brand, and birthing this project to actual life.

I only hope you will be on board, or at least open minded enough to try some things in the future with me, because if you know me in person, you know i hate disappointing people ;)

Anyway! More things to come, and a lot to tell you in the coming weeks!

I've already counted you in! I can't wait to see you then.

P.S. to the people who know already, you mean the world to me, and thanks for inspiring me to do this :)
