Had a hard time sleeping, woke up around 6, slept back around 8, and woke up finally at 10:30

Was a great day honestly, threw in a nice fit for errands, went to 6 shops, looking for outfits for lady gaga and halloween.

i was also mostly hoping to meet people along the way, spontaneously in the street. dont know, it makes me feel some sense of belongingness, or some sense of familiarity to the place.

or it could also be ego? to know someone in a place makes me feel less of a visitor, but more of an actual resident, who has memories and stories already passed and written.

anyway, i finished most of my errands, things in the house, even went swimming and cooking at home

it was a nice saturday indeed.

I've let it go. If it's meant to be, we'll be in our lives again.

Went for sushi went my bestie, talked about parents, life as immigrants, dreams, the past, the future.

it was really nice. had these street churros that were very dry but satisfied my cravings

now in bed with a full stomach, just killing time for sleep

I felt angry, but also chill, careless, but also careful? Its this feeling of uncertainty, on how im supposed to feel, because things are too blurry to actually see the lines of what it actually is.

i spoke about it with my roomie, my bestfriend, and that helped a lot

it's not a big deal, it just dents my thinking on self worth, and the standards i've put up and put down for people.

that part makes me think about it more, rather than the actual thing itself

anyway, we'll get by as always ;)

Relieved that coming back to work wasn't so stressful. I'm always thinking if this will always be how im feeling for the majority of my life, working on something that I know is not what I want but continuing because it is what pays the bills.

Went back to the gym routine, everyone for some reason was nice today in the gym, it was even empty! 

Went home to read and learn spanish, also improved my dating profile.

I dont know, i still think creating your dating profile is so performative, trying to create this persona with the highest potential of matching with people. seems so sad, but also necessary. it's feels cruel

i continue to read my book, and try to fall asleep.
this guys i used to date is also annoying me, i dont know why.
like we aren't anything, but the fact he has kept me on read for almost over a day?

i know he doesnt owe me anything, but even my friends wont do that. dunno, just annoyed

going to sleep now :p

Today was a good day. I did a mental health day from work, and did what I've wanted to do for a very long time: organize my office, buy new plates, vintage shop, and exercise.

I also managed to cook some healthy fried rice which tasted really good and I'm excited to eat the other portion tomorrow.

It was a pretty packed day, and I didnt check the work notifications until tonight, and as I expected, they can survive 1 day without me :D

I did however think about my ex a lot, probably thanks to the horrendous state of dating right now.

This feeling of being guilty, because I made the decision myself, but also the feeling of loss, for losing someone who truly loved me, and showed me what it felt like to be so.

It's also the gut wrenching feeling of standing strong on my decision, because I know it was, and is, the right decision.

What a trifling feeling. it gets exhausting and i get sad.

luckily, i went to exercise with my friends, and that helped a lot.

now im going to continue on reading this spanish book, im starting to like it. i get why it's a classic

also im finishing the habits book! what a great read.

it's a monday, and it started out as gray as it could with rain over and outside my window

all was good though, woke up to clean some dishes from the night before, as i wait for the water to boil.

made coffee, eggs, and had some leftover baos from the weekend before. read a chapter from a book, and steadied on to work afterwards

i always feel like mondays and tuesdays are the hardest in terms of my work, because its when my managers ask for updates, and its not that i dont have any updates, its just that this feeling of pretending that this is important or this task is urgent, is another job of pretending in itself.

i push through, regardless of the constant checking of my phone for some mental candy from instagram, whatsapp, or hinge

then went to the gym, but the app that allows me to check in didnt work, waited for 25 mins and left. decided to go shopping for winter / fall clothes, and finally bought a book a guy i used to date recommended me.

i didnt buy it because he recommended it, i bought it because the story actually captivated me to read it

or maybe im in denial, who knows :p anyway, went home and treated myself to a homemade burrito (so good btw)

and now rosalia is releasing some new music, and im off to read a portion of the book

we'll see how i progress (its in spanish soooo, wish me luck!)

my first journal, i've been reading a lot, thinking about how wonderful yesterday was when we were in Kat's apartment: drinking, eating, talking, and just being around friends.

that also explains why i feel a bit hungover, from all the wine i mean, but also from the decline of dopamine from such good social interaction. i dont feel sad, just on the decline. hope that's normal

i also went to Barre class with Marilyn, and we had a big fat brunch that was hitting all the cravings: good eggs, pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns, good bacon, and ice cream.

we walked from sarria to sagrera, to walk off the calories (or the hopes of it), but that made me realize how different people and the vibes are across neighborhoods.

People are well dressed, civilized?, clean, but also super white, and the same. Got mixed feelings honestly. Like i want to acknowledge how the place looks really posh, but also the feeling of wanting to be part of it, but also the disdain of how posh it is. 

dunno, 99% of the time, i dont really know why im feeling certain things

maybe thats why im journaling, in the hopes of spitting out the thoughts inside unto the webpage :D

anyway, im going to go back to reading! and recipe making

im happy these days, tired, but happy for the sense of direction, and goals.

ps. dating is so whack right now, people are so performative, or are just there for attention, and nobody wants to get to know one another

not to sounds too snarky, but thats just what i observed

anywayyy, thats itt, sunday thoughts, beating the sunday scaries
