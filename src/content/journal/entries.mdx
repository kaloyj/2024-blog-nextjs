my first journal, i've been reading a lot, thinking about how wonderful yesterday was when we were in Kat's apartment: drinking, eating, talking, and just being around friends.

that also explains why i feel a bit hungover, from all the wine i mean, but also from the decline of dopamine from such good social interaction. i dont feel sad, just on the decline. hope that's normal

i also went to Barre class with Marilyn, and we had a big fat brunch that was hitting all the cravings: good eggs, pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns, good bacon, and ice cream.

we walked from sarria to sagrera, to walk off the calories (or the hopes of it), but that made me realize how different people and the vibes are across neighborhoods.

People are well dressed, civilized?, clean, but also super white, and the same. Got mixed feelings honestly. Like i want to acknowledge how the place looks really posh, but also the feeling of wanting to be part of it, but also the disdain of how posh it is. 

dunno, 99% of the time, i dont really know why im feeling certain things

maybe thats why im journaling, in the hopes of spitting out the thoughts inside unto the webpage :D

anyway, im going to go back to reading! and recipe making

im happy these days, tired, but happy for the sense of direction, and goals.

ps. dating is so whack right now, people are so performative, or are just there for attention, and nobody wants to get to know one another

not to sounds too snarky, but thats just what i observed

anywayyy, thats itt, sunday thoughts, beating the sunday scaries
