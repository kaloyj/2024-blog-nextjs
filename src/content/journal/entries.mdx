it's a monday, and it started out as gray as it could with rain over and outside my window

all was good though, woke up to clean some dishes from the night before, as i wait for the water to boil.

made coffee, eggs, and had some leftover baos from the weekend before. read a chapter from a book, and steadied on to work afterwards

i always feel like mondays and tuesdays are the hardest in terms of my work, because its when my managers ask for updates, and its not that i dont have any updates, its just that this feeling of pretending that this is important or this task is urgent, is another job of pretending in itself.

i push through, regardless of the constant checking of my phone for some mental candy from instagram, whatsapp, or hinge

then went to the gym, but the app that allows me to check in didnt work, waited for 25 mins and left. decided to go shopping for winter / fall clothes, and finally bought a book a guy i used to date recommended me.

i didnt buy it because he recommended it, i bought it because the story actually captivated me to read it

or maybe im in denial, who knows :p anyway, went home and treated myself to a homemade burrito (so good btw)

and now rosalia is releasing some new music, and im off to read a portion of the book

we'll see how i progress (its in spanish soooo, wish me luck!)

my first journal, i've been reading a lot, thinking about how wonderful yesterday was when we were in Kat's apartment: drinking, eating, talking, and just being around friends.

that also explains why i feel a bit hungover, from all the wine i mean, but also from the decline of dopamine from such good social interaction. i dont feel sad, just on the decline. hope that's normal

i also went to Barre class with Marilyn, and we had a big fat brunch that was hitting all the cravings: good eggs, pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns, good bacon, and ice cream.

we walked from sarria to sagrera, to walk off the calories (or the hopes of it), but that made me realize how different people and the vibes are across neighborhoods.

People are well dressed, civilized?, clean, but also super white, and the same. Got mixed feelings honestly. Like i want to acknowledge how the place looks really posh, but also the feeling of wanting to be part of it, but also the disdain of how posh it is. 

dunno, 99% of the time, i dont really know why im feeling certain things

maybe thats why im journaling, in the hopes of spitting out the thoughts inside unto the webpage :D

anyway, im going to go back to reading! and recipe making

im happy these days, tired, but happy for the sense of direction, and goals.

ps. dating is so whack right now, people are so performative, or are just there for attention, and nobody wants to get to know one another

not to sounds too snarky, but thats just what i observed

anywayyy, thats itt, sunday thoughts, beating the sunday scaries
