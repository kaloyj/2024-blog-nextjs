        story: "The sauce is a combination of chilies, scallions, soy sauce, vinegar, and ginger. A dish my favorite chef Sohla el Waylly taught me during the pandemic as I was preparing to move to Europe. I promised myself to cook this one day, and it's a full circle moment serving this now."

        story: "Never was my childhood favourite, but because I've always thought it was the rich person's version of a normal lumpia. This is me reclaiming the lost time on such a simple yet amazing dish. Chinese crepe filled with enoki mushrooms, bean sprouts, sweet potato, carrots, and chicken, all infused with miso and garlic, topped with a soy peanut glaze."

Braised with laurel leaves, dried flower blossoms, soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar, this filling punches you with flavor, and to pair it with the homemade baos, will hopefully allow you to have memories as simple and strong as mine."
